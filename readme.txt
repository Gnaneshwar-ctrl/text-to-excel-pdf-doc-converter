i prefer to use jupyter .. if u are using visual studio , intlliji or cmd then need to add "import os"
 #######df = pd.read_csv("     ",sep = ':') --> mention the file name in the space if using in jupyter if u have imported/uploaded the file else mention the complete location importing os module
 #######df.to_excel("     ", 'Sheet1') --> as mentioned above change is u need to mention the absolute destination location.
 
 
 similarly follow the same steps for pdf and word ..
